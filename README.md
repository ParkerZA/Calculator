# Calculator

Attempt to create a calculator that receives entire operation in one line, instead of one by one. 
Converted input into string, used operation characters (+,-,/,*) as delimiters and separated the digits and operations into separate arrays, stored as chars.
In the end could not get the program to prioritize multiplication and division operations over addition and subtraction while storing the result in the array, as it is difficult to resize arrays after initializion. May try again in future using linked lists.
